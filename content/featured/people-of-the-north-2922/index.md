## *People of the North* — A Journey Through Nordic Culture

[*People of the North* is a popular documentary-travel TV series](https://www.peopleofthenorth.net/season-two/s2e6-noble-adventures) that takes viewers on a scenic tour through the far reaches of Northern Europe, especially Norway and other Nordic regions. The show blends breathtaking landscapes with intimate stories about the people, food, traditions, and lifestyles that define life in these rugged and beautiful places.  

Hosted by Norwegian TV personality **Arne Hjeltnes**, alongside chef **Frida Ronge** and award-winning distiller **Stig Bareksten**, the series highlights local culture and cuisine as the team explores small towns, seaside communities, fishing villages, and remote natural wonders.  

Each episode focuses on a different location — from the Arctic coast and remote fishing hamlets to islands and fjords — introducing viewers to distinctive traditions, sustainable ways of living, and local heroes whose lives are deeply tied to the land and sea.  

Now in its third season, *People of the North* continues to air on networks like PBS in the United States and is available on various international platforms. The series has reached millions of viewers globally and has received recognition for its role in promoting Norwegian culture and travel.
