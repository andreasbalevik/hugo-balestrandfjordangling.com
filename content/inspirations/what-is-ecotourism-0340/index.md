**Ecotourism is responsible travel** to natural areas that focuses on conserving the environment, supporting local communities, and minimizing negative impacts, by providing memorable experiences that build environmental and cultural awareness and contribute directly to nature conservation and local development. It is about balancing ecological, social, and economic considerations to ensure sustainable tourism.

#### Key Principles:

**Nature and Cultural Conservation:** Travel to pristine areas to experience wildlife and plants, with the goal of protecting them.

**Environmental Responsibility:** Minimizing your footprint by using low-impact facilities, reducing waste, and avoiding overconsumption.

**Community Support:** Supporting local businesses, using local ingredients and labor, and ensuring that revenues benefit the local community.

**Education and Experience:** Creating meaningful learning experiences that increase understanding of environmental and cultural values.

#### Examples:

**Activities:** Birdwatching, hiking in national parks, Fishing trips, guided tours focusing on local flora/fauna.

**Accommodation:** Stay in small, sustainable lodges or hotels that use renewable energy.

**Culture:** Visit local communities, participate in local traditions (respectfully).

#### Why is it important?

Ecotourism provides an alternative to mass tourism by creating economic value from intact nature, which motivates conservation. It provides local people with an alternative to other, more harmful industries, and promotes respect for both nature and culture.
