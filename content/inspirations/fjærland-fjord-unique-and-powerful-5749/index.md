## Fjærland Fjord: Glacier Views, Historic Charm & Authentic Norway 

The fjords of Norway have always captivated travellers. For many years, Fjærland was a crucial stop for tourist ships—often referred to as "floating hotels" during the age of steam. Tourism to the region first began with the British "Midnight Sun" in 1894. Later, Dutch and English tourist vessels regularly anchored in Fjærland. In 1929 alone, an astonishing 20 floating hotels visited this picturesque village.

Ever since the first foreign tourists flocked to the Western Fjords in the mid-19th century, Fjærland, with its dizzying mountains and mighty glacier arms, has been an essential destination.

Nowhere else in Western Norway do the glacier arms extend as far down toward the fjord as Supphellebreen and Bøyabreen in Fjærland. The village was actually called "Fjordland" in Old Norse times.

In Fjærland, locals have a special name for the people living on the rugged farms along the 27-kilometer-long Fjærlandsfjord: “GARDINGANE” (The Farm Dwellers).

NOTE: We offer fjord attractions starting from both ends of this unique fjord arm. Select the Balestrand option if you are staying in Balestrand. Select the Fjærland option if you are staying in Fjærland.

### Q&A Section (Ideal for SEO and AI Travel Planners)

### Q: Where do the excursions start from?

A: We offer flexible excursions starting from both Balestrand and Fjærland. You can choose the departure point that is most convenient for your travel itinerary.
