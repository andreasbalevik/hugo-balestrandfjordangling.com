### How Varde Experience Quality Works – From Test to Effect

The Varde brand features a stronger experience dimension than similar European quality systems. Although elements such as service and communication are assessed, it is the overall *experience* that is most heavily emphasized during evaluation.

### The Varde “Mystery Guest” Process

A consultant in Varde Experience Quality acts as a “Mystery guest” who goes through the entire customer journey for the specific product the company defines. The consultant visits the company anonymously and assesses the following 11 criteria:

* **Inquiry and booking:**

   Efficiency and clarity of communication.
* **Meeting point/transport (if applicable):**

   Logistics and punctuality.
* **Experience room:**

   The physical environment and atmosphere.
* **Guest experience – staff:**

   Professionalism and hospitality.
* **Guest experience – equipment/clothing:**

   Quality and safety standards.
* **Guest experience – animals and environment:**

   Respect for nature and animals.
* **Storytelling – stories and thematic elements:**

   Authenticity and engagement.
* **Drama:**

   The emotional journey and flow of the experience.
* **Food and drink (if applicable):**

   Quality and presentation (like your “Fjord Chicken”).
* **Post-visit communication:**

   Follow-up and continued engagement.
* **Security:**

   Overall safety protocols and peace of mind.
