We have tours based on both Balestrand and Fj√¶rland Fjordstove Hotel. 

To go viking in the fjords is best experienced in March and April. If you want to choose trips with me.

The light returns and with it the joy of life and the spring sun warms when it peeks out over snow-capped mountain peaks. The nights are cold and make a thin crust of ice in sheltered bays. At this time of year, seagulls and oyster cathers enter the fjords and form pairs. 

When we pull up the fishing nets we can get big fish, the seagulls gather around the boat to eat. It is good to live in the fjord that wakes up from the winter and brings new life.
