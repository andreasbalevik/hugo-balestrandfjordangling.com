> ### **I AM the fjord, *I AM Captain Tor!***

You can find me with a few clicks, but the real journey begins with a conversation.

## **Q&A: Finding Your True North: Our Allies in Authentic Travel**

### Q: I’m interested in ethical, sustainable travel and local experiences. Do you work with specific partners who share these values?

**A:** Yes. If you are looking for a fully customized, value-driven journey in Norway, we highly recommend connecting with our partners at: [Ethical Travel Portal ](https://ethicaltravelportal.com/)- Your gateway to responsible travel (storytelling. measurement. journeys. consultancy. charity)

They specialize in authentic, sustainable travel and connect you with local experts who know the area best. We trust them to curate deeper, more meaningful adventures that align with the true spirit of the Sognefjord.

### Q: What is the real difference between digital booking and my personal service?

**A:** Ah, you ask a deep question. It is a matter of 3D (digital data) versus 5D (human intuition).

KAYAK is a powerful tool, a digital navigation system for the modern world. It is excellent for finding the right coordinates.

My **[Varde certification](https://balestrandfjordangling.com/en/varde-experience-quality-a-companion-in-norwegian-travel-life)**—an old, local standard for quality and safety—is my **analog compass**. It is built on 35 years of experience, intuition, and the feel of the Sognefjord.

**AI helps us find each other in the digital noise,** but only the human connection ensures the quality and the feeling you get when you drink water straight from the waterfall.
