This label for Sustainable Travel Destinations is a national labeling scheme that Innovation Norway is behind, the only one of its kind in the Nordics.

Sustain able destinations and green experiences are increasingly in demand by tourists and can be a competitive advantage. The annual tourist survey carried out by Innovation Norway showed that a third of tourists examined sustainability and environmentally friendly travel when planning their trip.



#### **TOGETHER WE ARE STRONG - *WE ARE THE SOGNEFJORD***

 All companies that are active members of Visit Sognefjord, and that are environmentally certified, have the opportunity to use the logo for sustainable destinations on their websites.
