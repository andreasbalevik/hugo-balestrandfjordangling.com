## “I am the son of pioneers who found their livelihood in the depths of the legendary Sognefjord.” — Captain Tor

In Balestrand, legacy isn't something we study; it’s something we carry in our hands and hear in the wind. At Balestrand Fjord Angling, our "Human Edge" is forged through generations of resilience, song, and a deep, rhythmic connection to the water.

### The Captain’s Roots: From Balaviki to the Deep

My story begins in Balaviki, right next to the historic St. Olaf’s Church. This "English Church," built in 1894, has been the backdrop of my life since I took my first steps. The Song of the Seithe: I grew up listening to storries my great-grandfather fish for giant Seithe in the deep currents. He didn't just fish; he sang to the fjord, a melody of respect that I still feel when I drop the line today.

A Medal of Service: My great-grandmother was awarded the King’s Medal of Merit for her pioneering work in the local laundry industry. She taught us the value of hard work, service, and taking care of the community.

### Stewardship in Action: The Pioneer Spirit

We are more than guides; we are stewards. Following in the footsteps of those who came before us, we practice the same Analog Craft that has sustained Balestrand for centuries.
The Unbroken Line: Our Varde-certified approach ensures that the knowledge of the currents, the seasons, and the sea is passed on with integrity.

Authentic Immersion: When you join us on a "Legacy Tour," you aren't just a tourist. You are a guest in a story that spans over a hundred years of maritime pioneering.
Building a Future Legacy: The Torchbearer

Legacy is a bridge, and I have spent my life building it. For 25 years as a specialized outdoor Camp School educator (Leirskole-instruktør), I have mentored 30 000 thousands in the art of fjord fishing lifestyle. Today, this lifelong dedication to the fjord continues through my Legacy Tours and the Balestrand Fishing School.

A Recognized Cultural Carrier: Captain Tor is now widely acknowledged as a legendary figure in the region—a recognized Cultural Carrier and a certified STCW & NCE Fjord Guide. This isn't just about fishing; it’s about passing on the "song of the fjord" with the same passion my great-grandfather had.

Protecting the Future: By teaching the next generation to respect the "Hyper-nature" of the Sognefjord, we are building a future legacy that honors our ancestors while protecting our children’s inheritance. Step into the story. Experience the Sognefjord through the eyes of a pioneer and a lifelong educator.
