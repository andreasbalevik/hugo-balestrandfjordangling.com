description: I live in Norway, in the never–summer land of Balestrand in the
  middle of the Sognefjord. It's 4275 feet deep and far away from the crowded
  cities and tourist resorts of Europe..

### *In my fjords, when spring finally comes to save me from a perpetual winter,*

*my world comes alive again, and I remember why I am here. I am a son of a long line of fjord fishermen and pioneers in Balevik bay who make a living from what the Sognefjord has to offer. And when I get the first bookings from tourist guest in the spring, I love to see them rediscover this Sognefjord world and be filled with wonder and presence.*

### *I can see them as an expression of my own restless spirit.*

*Charged with an appetite for adventure, they take to the fjords without hesitation. They are pure power! When I see them in my boat present and free, I often think of the Vikings and how they were the true pioneers of the Sognefjord.*

### *I believe there is a force in the Sognefjord,*

*that lives beneath the surface. Something primitive and wild that awakens when you need an extra push just to survive. Like the oyster-catcher who whistles spring back on the shore and the pollack willingly bites the hook.*

### *Most people are afraid of this natural force,*

*this fire in the soul and keep it buried deep inside themselves. But there will always be a few people who have the courage to love what is untamed inside us... Finding the way back to who I am!*
