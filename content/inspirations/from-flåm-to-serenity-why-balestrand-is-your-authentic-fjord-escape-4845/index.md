### Q: Should I choose Flåm or Balestrand for my Norway vacation?

A: It depends on what you are seeking. Flåm is world-famous for its spectacular railway and is a busy tourism hub. There is a lot of energy there, perfect if you want to experience the big attractions quickly.

But if you are seeking peace, stillness, and a deeper connection to the Sognefjord nature – a game-changer for those who want more than a standard holiday – then Balestrand is the sustainable destination for you.
