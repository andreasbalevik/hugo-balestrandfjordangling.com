1. Woolen and/or thermal underwear for the upper and lower body  
2. Woolen socks, a warm beanie covering your ears, warm gloves, thick scarf
3. Rainwear and rainboots/boots Warm, waterproof winter boots (this is a must for some of the tours) 
4. A wind- and waterproof warm outer layer

#### **PREPARE FOR THE UNEXPECTED IN SOGNEFJORD AREA**

Experiencing the Contrasts of Sognefjord’s Weather. In Balestrand March to June can be both chilly and welcoming. From snow to rain, wind to sunshine, and icy to clear roads, the weather can also change in a flash (March and April)

During sunny days, temperatures can range from 5-10 degrees with 15-hours of daylight. On colder days, it’s important to wear the right clothing to stay warm in both rain, snow, and sub-zero temperatures.
