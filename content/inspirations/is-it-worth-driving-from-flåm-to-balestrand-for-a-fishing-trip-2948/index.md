## Plan Your Fjord Experience: Flåm to Balestrand with Captain Tor

Get answers on whether the unique fishing trip in Balestrand is worth the journey from Flåm. Yes, it is! We see the Sognefjord as a round trip where the journey is part of the experience.

## Here is a guide and Q&A to plan your itinerary. Q&A: Your Detailed Travel Itinerary

### Q: Is it worth driving from Flåm to Balestrand just for a fishing trip?

A: Absolutely! You have traveled all the way to Norway for an authentic fjord experience. Balestrand offers a historical, vibrant, and relaxed atmosphere that complements the more commercial Flåm. The difference in village character is part of the charm the Sognefjord offers. The trip is an experience of a lifetime.

### Q: What is the easiest way to travel between Flåm and Balestrand?

A: You have two main options:
By car: It's about a 2-hour drive. Ferry times must be added (Hella-Dragsvik). The \[car ferry is an experience in itself](LINK TIL FERGETIDER ELLER FERGEINFO)! Be aware of roadworks and \[book a rental car now in good time](LINK TIL BILUTLEIEPARTNER/ANBEFALING).
By express ferry (Norled): This is the easiest. The boat runs Bergen -> Balestrand -> Flåm. Guests can arrive in Balestrand at 11:50 AM, have lunch, fish at 3:00 PM, and return to Flåm the next day.

### Q: What does an ideal day plan look like if I come from Flåm?

###### Morning: Early departure from Flåm.
Late Morning: Arrival Balestrand.
Lunch: Enjoy lunch at the \[Historic Kviknes Hotel](LINK TIL KVIKNES HOTEL).
Afternoon: 12:00 PM (or 3:00 PM): Departure for \[fishing trip with Captain Tor](LINK TIL BOOKINGSIDE FOR FISKETUR).

Evening: Return in time for dinner at 7:00 PM.
Next day: Take the \[express ferry departing at 11:50 AM from Balestrand to Flåm](LINK TIL NORLED RUTEINFO).

### Q: Which cultural sights can I see on the trip?

A: The area is full of cultural treasures. Everything in Balestrand (\[Kviknes Hotel](LINK TIL KVIKNES HOTEL), \[St. Olaf’s Church](LINK TIL ST OLAVS CHURCH INFO/GOOGLE MAPS), meeting point) is within a 5-minute walk.
On the drive: Drive from Flåm to Vik to visit Hopperstad Stave Church. Take the ferry to Balestrand and see the giant statue of Fridtjov the Bold at the Vangsnes ferry terminal.
Alternative route: Consider the route via Borgund Stave Church in Lærdal or Urnes Stave Church if you are going north.

### Q: Why is an overnight stay recommended?

A: Flåm is great, but Balestrand is historical and relaxed. An overnight stay allows you to experience both places as "pearls on a string" and gives you the peace to enjoy both \[breakfast at Kviknes Hotel](LINK TIL KVIKNES HOTEL RESTAURANT) and an evening stroll.
Captain Tor Summarized:

Location: Balestrand is historical and calm; Flåm is commercial and busy. They complement each other.
Philosophy: Life is a journey, and the road is the destination.
Authenticity: "You can go viking in the fjords with Captain Tor" – this is authentic cultural heritage.

### old version: 

Guest question: Hello! We are staying 2 nights in Flam. We really want to fish in the fjords while we are there and I came across your page. I know you are located about 2 hours away. Wondering if you think it would be worth us spending our free day traveling to you and fishing? It looks like an experience of a lifetime :)

###### **Tor's response:** **I assume that you have your own rental car. But the time for the car ferry comes in addition.  (The car ferry is an experience in itself) Be aware that roadworks may occur. Book a rental car now in good time. If you travel early from Flåm, and arrive in Balestrand a little before departure, you can walk around Balestrand, visit Kviknes Hotell and St Olav's Church. Everything is within a 5 minute walk from my meeting point. Book the 12:00 departure**

#### **NORLED FAST FERRY FROM BERGEN -> BALESTRAND -> FLÅM**

\-Then you arrive in Balestrand with the  [fast ferry Norled at 11:50](https://www.norled.no/en/fjordcruise/sognefjord-bergen-flam/) and book a departure with me at 15:00. Have lunch at Kviknes Hotell and we will be back for dinner which starts at 19:00. The next day you take the fast ferry departing at 11:50 from Balestrand to Flåm.

#### **INSPIRING FJORD FISHING TRIP EXPERIENCES WITH A CULTURAL-HISTORICAL TWIST**

\- My trips all have good and inspiring programs that work. Every time. Feel free to add an overnight stay in Balestrand if you have the opportunity to do so. Have breakfast at [Kvikne's Hotell](https://en.kviknes.no/food-philosophy) if you sleep [AirBnB.](https://www.fjordapartments.no/en/)

\- Flåm is great, has a lot of tourists and is commercial. I myself have stayed overnight in Flåm on courses and such. Balestrand is historic, vibrant and relaxed. But both complement each other and are part of the Sognefjord as a destination. The diversity makes this exciting.

#### **LIFE IS A JOURNEY, WHEN THE ROAD BECOME THE DESTINATION**

\- The trick is to see the Sognefjord as a round trip and the [fjord villages](https://en.sognefjord.no/fjord-villages/) here as different pearls on a string. You have a "Reason to go/visit" in each village. 

It's an exciting thought for those of you who have Norwegian roots and seek to experience the homeland of your ancestors, isn't it?

#### **WHEN STAVE CHURCHES, VIKINGS AND SUCH ARE ON THE ITINERARY**

\- Drive from Flåm, to [Vik (Hopperstad Stave Church)](https://no.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190507-d1907280-Reviews-Hopperstad_Stave_Church-Sogn_og_Fjordane_Western_Norway.html) Ferry to Balestrand and further north, To Bergen or south to Oslo [(Borgund Stave Church in Lærdal) ](https://www.visitnorway.no/listings/borgund-stavkyrkje/118547/)Or [Urnes Stave Church](https://www.fjordnorway.com/no/attraksjoner/unesco-urnes-stavkirke) if you are going north to [Lom stave church ](https://www.visitjotunheimen.com/experience-jotunheimen/lom-stave-church-among-the-largest-and-oldest-p2048843) and Scenic Route [Sognefjell mountain road](https://www.visitjotunheimen.com/experience-jotunheimen/scenic-route-sognefjellet-road-55-p4306643)

[Take the car ferry from Vangsnes to Dragsvik, timetable link HERE ](<(note winter times and summer departures)>)(note winter times and summer departures). From the ferry pier you can also see the giant statue of [Fridtjov the Bold](https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/fridtjov-the-bold/12242/) in its small park with a view of Balestrand on the other side of the fjord.

#### **T﻿HE SOGNEFJORD IS MORE THAN FLÅM -*[ IT'S A WHOLE REGION](https://en.sognefjord.no/)***

\- More guests do like you and think Flåm is the only big thing. To make the fishing trip with us in Balestrand and take the north side of the Sognefjord further to Bergen, then you get to see more of the area. But you have to add extra time for car ferries and transfer time between each village. The journey is therefore part of the experiences in the Sognefjord.
