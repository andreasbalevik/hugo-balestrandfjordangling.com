## Discover the Authentic Esefjord Experience

Of course you can! Balestrand is close to the fjord and untouched nature. This popular, must-do, 5-star all-in-one attraction has received the prestigious Varde experience quality award, making it the perfect authentic Norwegian experience.

### This tour is suitable for everyone and is available year-round.

We operate private trips all year round with a start price that includes 3 people. It is suitable for couples, families with children, and friends traveling together. Is this an exciting opportunity for you?

> #### IT'S EASY, YOU CAN DO IT: BALESTRAND CULTURE

Here you get to see the famous red dragon villas in Balestrand from the sea side and learn a little about the people who built them. After 30 minutes of sightseeing, entertaining and good storytelling by Captain Tor, **You have two options for further boat trip:**

### OPTION 1: CATCH YOUR OWN FOOD & COOK AT HOME

Fun Fjord Angling in beautiful, legendary #Esefjorden

*(Surrounded by high picturesque mountains)*

"When I was a little boy, my mother used to send me out on the fjord to catch the fish called: Sand Whiting. They are fun to fish, bite easily on the hook and taste good for lunch. Some call them 'Fjord Chickens'- Isn't that cool?"

### Do you have any video inspiration from the tour?

Yes, absolutely! To really get a feel for the atmosphere, we’ve put together some short Instagram Reels. Take a look and let yourself be inspired by the magic of the Sognefjord:

> Teaser YouTube Episode : Watch Episode [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgKuXXlxM4o)

**This is a family trip where you also can experience the unexpected!**

### Can I cook my own catch?

Yes! Imagine catching your own fish and making your own dinner at ***home.*** Butter-fried Sand Whiting served on a piece of seed-loaf with a homemade salad and a bottle of local made fruit drink: *"Sprudlande Margaret"* from Balholm (Our local apple juice factory in Balestrand)

 It tastes rhubarb and evokes nostalgic summer memories.

### Where can I buy ingredients?

Easily buy ingredients in the grocery store next to the Balestrand Adventure house. If you light some candles and put on some bossa nova music in the background, you have a real dining experience you do together. How about a bag of fish soup, and add pieces of your fish?

> #### TRENDY & FUN LIFESTYLE

### This is a good solution for groups or a "Kick Off"

**A:** Yes, it's a perfect solution for a girl's/boy's trip! Combine a [\#Raudmelen mountain](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/312018818/raudmelen/)  mountain hiking trip in the morning with a relaxing, soft educational Fishing trip in the afternoon. It's a concrete mission to solve—time to gather the gang and order today!

Share our website and tell your friends about this opportunity in Balestrand of Norway.

## OPTION 2: SCENIC FJORD EXCURSION: CLEAN AIR & ESCAPE

Scenic Fjord excursion to small homestead farms in the beautiful #Fjærlandsfjorden

We speed up our boat and drive inwards towards the outer part of Fjærlandsfjorden which in bright season is green colored by melt water from the glacier village #fjærland.

> #### DIGITAL DETOX: RECHARGE YOUR SOUL

### What is special about the energy in Fjærlandsfjorden?

The energy in #Fjærlandsfjorden is described as special, original, and powerful. Surrounded by high mountains, it is said to nourish both the heart and the spirit. The area offers clean water, fresh air, and homesteads, providing peace, inspiration, and space for wonder. In the past, this beautiful fjord was known as *"Fjordland"*.

By the way: It's nice and tidy too..

> #### FJORD WELLNESS: ELEVATE YOUR JOURNEY

**Be generous with yourself; you've earned this break.** Experience the Sognefjord's magical vibes and elevate your journey with our **\[Popular 3-Hour Lifestyle Program](LINK TO YOUR PRODUCT PAGE HERE)**. This is not just a tour; it's an experience. **Level up your Norwegian adventure.**

### On the Go? Fly & Drive Sognefjord Logistics

Many of our guests arrive in the Sognefjord driving their own car, rental car, or motorhome/campervan after flying into Oslo (OSL), Bergen (BGO), or Ålesund (AES) airports. A stop in Balestrand for an authentic fjord experience with Captain Tor is a highlight of their itinerary. Our tours are flexible; simply park your vehicle (**Veganeset Camping, praised in The Guardian, is nearby**), jump aboard for your private excursion, and continue your journey the same day. Balestrand is centrally located between key ferry points (Dragsvik, Hella, Vangsnes), making it easy to integrate into your logistics. [Find the ferry timetable on the link HERE.](https://www.norled.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/fc6193ba-0fca-4561-b498-2e6f9898a40a.pdf)
