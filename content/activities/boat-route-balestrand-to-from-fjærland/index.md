#### **WHEN THE JOURNEY IS THE DESTINATION**

Different water falls, glaciers, homestead places without road. Find tranquility and value as we drive along the entire fjord.  A misty morning, a little rain and you glow like a real Viking! Decompress! Sit on the boat’s bow and dangle with your legs outside the boat, and feel the fresh air flicker in your hair, or the rain kissing your cheek  Add a Norwegian flag and you are on a fjord expedition! This is a very nice way to get close to the fjord, your self and nature. Some guests describe this trip as a "Fjord gallop" -> That's a cool thing, wanna try?

#### **THE SIMPLE AND AUTHENTIC IS THE NEW LUXURY**

Private Fjord travel in Fjærlandsfjord from Balestrand to the Fjærland Glacier Village. Perfect for those arriving Balestrand with the fast ferry from Flåm at the 16:50 arrival in Balestrand, and going on to [Fjærland Fjordstove Hotel.](https://fjaerlandhotel.com/) Or the opposite way. I will pick you up on the morning in Fjærland Fjordstove Hotel, if you are going to Balestrand, and you want to explore Balestrand,  before your 16:50 departure fast ferry to Bergen.

#### **THE STORYTELLING TOPS THIS UNIQUE FJORD JOURNEY**

We stop regularly and Captain Tor tells little stories. You drink water right from the source. You feel fresh water on your face and the smell of purity and nature. Trees that bloom in May and June. From June to August, the fjord is colored green by glacial melting water and plankton.

#### **TOURS ALL YEAR ROUND - *GO VIKING IN THE FJORD***

In winter, the fjord is deserted with with Avalanches and abandoned without humans and life. Only deer and eagles trying to survive the winter fjord landscape. Back to the real roots! Time stands still. Reflections as we travel by the boat. The fjord light and one freezes on the toes and there is real Viking feeling. Longing for a camp fire at the hotel

#### **LET GO - BREATHE - TIME FOR WONDER - *A BEUTIFUL LIFE***

You are free from all thoughts and worries and are living in the moment as we drives the boat. You are wonderful and grateful at the same time. Whether it rains or sunshine, it might blow a bit… It doesn’t matter for you to live and exist! Happiness.. and presence and.. far away at the same time …. in a distant place away from home. And You find your self thinking about things at home and in life. This constant attraction of being on the road to something new and unknown.. and the familiar nostalgia..
