#### ***G﻿O VIKING IN THE FJORDS - THE SEASON FROM OCTOBER TO APRIL***

Here you experience unique stream falls, glaciers on the horizon and road less homesteads at a suitable places along the entire fjord. Find peace and wonder while we fishing along along steep, high mountains. October-December is best for catching Pollock 

 Captain Tor's progressive, seamless fjord program reaps appreciative nods and smiles time and time again



#### **LEARN NEW SKILLS - CLEAN AIR - *REFRESHING MONENTS IN FJÆRLANDSFJORD***

A foggy morning, a little rain and you glow like a real Viking! Sit on the bow of the boat and dangle your legs and feel the fresh fjord air flutter in your hair.

 Let your keyboard fingers experience sea urchins, cold fishing nets and wet fish. Decompress! Sit on the boat’s bow and dangle with your legs outside the boat, and feel the fresh air flicker in your hair, or the rain kissing your cheek. 

#### **C﻿OLD HANDS - VARM HEARTS - *I AM SOGNEFJORD***

*"Neglesprett"* is a fun experience and typically Norwegian (a prickly feeling in the fingers) when you have been out and pulled up fishing nets from cold water and the heat returns to your hands Only comes when you have been out on an adventure.

#### **CURIOSITY - *THE NEW SUPER POWER***

Add a Norwegian flag and you're on a fjord expedition! In winter, it's desolate and barren in here. In February and March, the snow descends in avalanches down steep mountains and right into the spring rocks. Eagles, deer and marine mammals also roam. Orcas! Did you know that whale poo is important for fertilizing ecosystems and thus plankton production?

We also have sharks in the Sognefjorden, Dogfish! It swims up from the depths in search of herring and has skin teeth that feel like sandpaper when you stroke it. Very stylish experience.

#### ***WHEN THE JOURNEY IS THE DESTINATION..***

We stop along the way. Tor has grown up here in the village, shares passionate knowledge and so that you understand the context in a fun way. Some Fjord tourists describe this trip as a beautiful fjord gallop. Want to try?

With Kaptein Tor you get a progressive program with parallel associations, emotions and vitality as a driving force. With such a strategy, we raise creativity and refine the dynamics in the group and thus also conversion rates in your company. You will experience clients who notice a brand new drive and vitality in the team.

> #### **TRAVELING IS NOT ABOUT PRACTICAL USE, BUT RATHER AN EXPRESSION OF INDIVIDUALITY. A FJORD ADVENTURE IS JUST A PIECE OF ICONOGRAPHY.**

The energy in #fjærlandsfjorden is special, more original. There is a power here in this fjord, among the high mountains, which strengthens both your heart and your spirit. This power makes us strong men and women. Captain Tor knows how to find this experience.
