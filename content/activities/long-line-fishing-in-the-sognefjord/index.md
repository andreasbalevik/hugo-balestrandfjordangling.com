#### **T﻿HE REAL STUFF, LOCAL AND GENUINE -**

\- Captain Tor is on his way out in the open boat called “Balestrand Fjord Angling” A specially built boat Øyen 620F. F stands for fisherman. Here is clean, tidy, simple and safe. This long line fishery is proper local tradition for food down to 1000 m deep. This is how my family has been fishing for 4 generations. The fish was salted with us and Ling fish were hung to dry on the boathouse wall for “lutefisk”
