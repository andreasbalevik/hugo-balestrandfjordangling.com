### The Experience (Optimized Q&A Section)

### Q: When can I book this unique expedition?

A: This tour operates in April and May, just as the fjord awakens to life after its winter hibernation. This is the prime time for catching various fish species using nets and lines in the rich Fjærlandsfjord. It’s a true mindful travel experience.

### Q: How does the unique two-step fishing process work?

A: This program is designed to build anticipation and genuine excitement! It’s a truly immersive experience:

Evening Before (6:00 PM): We start the night before the main tour by heading out onto the fjord to set the deep-water nets, lines, and crab traps.
Expedition Day (9:00 AM): The next morning, we meet again to haul in the gear. The feeling of expectation and excitement is a core part of this program. What will we find in the nets?

### Q: What can we expect to catch in the nets and traps?

A: This is the thrilling moment of discovery! We can catch a wide variety of marine life. Perhaps a large cod, a ray, a harmless dogfish shark, or even a ghost shark (Havmus) with its green eyes and venomous spines?

With over 25 years of experience guiding 30,000 students in the Sognefjord, Captain Tor guarantees an educational experience for the whole family. We commonly find cod, various white fish, and crabs. It’s always exciting to see what treasures we find!

### Q: Is this program famous from TV?

A: Yes, absolutely! This authentic experience with Captain Tor was featured on the popular documentary series People of the North. You can join the expedition and follow in the footsteps of the show’s crew.

### Q: Why is this experience historically relevant?

A: The fjord was the "road" for Vikings who set out from Balestrand in search of adventure. The word fjord means "to travel" from old Norse. Our boat, "Miss Fjords," is the contemporary answer to the resilient Fjord horse and the agile Viking ship—built for stability, safety, and silent passage, channeling that ancient spirit of exploration.

### Q: How does the pickup/start location work?

A: We offer flexible start locations for your convenience. Captain Tor lives in Balestrand and navigates the fjord daily.
If you are staying at the Fjærland Fjordstove Hotel, we can pick you up directly at Fjærland Marina.

If you are staying in Balestrand, your tour starts right from the main harbor there.
The journey from Balestrand into the Fjærlandsfjord provides a unique, scenic mini-cruise as part of the total experience!

### Q: What makes this a “world-class” adventure?

A: You deserve the best. Captain Tor is a certified maritime STCW instructor with unique qualities who guarantees a safe, inspiring and educational experience. We deliver genuine solutions—professional oil hire gear and sea boots—so you can connect directly with the elements. Be prepared for cheerful moments and repetitive work movements that help you find peace and focus.

### Q: How should I prepare for the weather?

A: We operate in the inner fjord area (Mundal - Lidal). It’s chilly this time of year as the fjord awakens. Pack good wool underwear, a hat, and quality mittens. The water is usually calm. When the sun hits, the atmosphere is incredible! Remember sunglasses :)

### Q: Do you have any video inspiration from the tour?

A: Yes, absolutely! To really get a feel for the atmosphere, we’ve put together some short inspiration clips and the full documentary episode:
