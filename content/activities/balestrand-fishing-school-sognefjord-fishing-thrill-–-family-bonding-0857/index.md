## **This is the Perfect Gift: Trade Screen Time for Sognefjord ‘Adventure Time’**

### A unique, highly sought-after experience for kids, spouses, or friends.

It is time to trade screen time for *authentic **‘adventure time.’*** Join us for a hands-on experience where we combine traditional rod fishing and the unique challenge of checking our pre-set fishing nets.This is the perfect surprise gift that offers simple, high-quality immersion in nature you crave—a chance to truly breathe and disconnect from daily life.

### **Your Rare Expedition Possibility & A Meaningful Investment**

**This is the highly sought-after Fishing Culture Adventure Trip around Balestrand Village** and a meaningful investment in shared moments and connection. Opportunities to make memories like this are limited. It is always exciting to see what treasures we find in the net! 

## **THE ART OF MAKING SOMETHING: FJORD ACTIVITY!**

Captain Tor’s fjord solutions work time and time again. You are looking for an activity that’s a safe bet and guarantees a good time – aren’t you? This is also the trip we offer in the cold Winter season.

> ***Chilled by the fjord, warmed by the soul. A Sognefjord signature.***

### **The unique about the fishing here in the Esefjord**

This fishing trip in the beautiful, legendary Esefjord is surrounded by high, picturesque mountains. This specific fjord arm is known for easy and fun fishing, perfect for all skill levels. As Captain Tor says:

> **Memories about fishing:** “I was a little boy, my mother used to send me out on the fjord to catch the fish called: ***Sand Whiting***. They are fun to fish, bite easily on the hook, and taste great for lunch. Some call them **‘Fjord Chickens’** – that’s a brilliant name!”

### **The *‘Fjord Chicken’* Challenge: Easy & Fun Fjord Fishing in Esefjord**

### How can I cook my catch and what ingredients do I need?

Imagine this happened to you: Catch some fish with Captain Tor and make your own dinner when you get home. We suggest butter-fried Sand Whiting served on a piece of seed-loaf with a homemade salad and a bottle of local made fruit drink: “Sprudlande Margaret” from Balholm.

* It tastes rhubarb and evokes nostalgic summer memories.
* If you light some candles and put on some bossa nova music in the background, you have a real dining experience you do together.
* Easily buy all necessary ingredients (seed loaf, salad, local drinks) in the grocery store next to the Balestrand Adventure house.

### Here is easy cooking ideas for a quick meal:

How about a bag of fish soup, and add pieces of your fresh fish? It doesn’t get easier than that!

Treat yourself to a lunch menu at the Historic Kviknes Hotel - the Sognefjord sandwich, the taste of the Sognefjord!

## **CURIOSITY & WONDER: A VIKING EXPEDITION OF DISCOVERY**

### We include two different fishing methods in this tour

 This “LEGACY TOUR” program has more focus on activity, and we have added a fishing net to the experience.

### What can we catch with the fishing net?

Pulling up the fishing nets, which are set out by us the night before, stimulates practical skills and is always an exciting moment! We can catch a wide variety of marine life.

**With over 25 years of experience at the local nature school, where I’ve guided 30,000 students in exploring the Sognefjord, I guarantee an educational and exciting experience for the whole family.** It is incredible how rich the life in the fjord is - we even found up to 50 different species in just one week! Join us and discover your own treasures. Here are some of the most common finds in the net:

> It is ALWAYS exciting to see what treasures we find in the net. But an empty net is not a failure; it is a lesson in patience and endurance. **A Viking’s spirit is forged not in comfort, but in the face of the elements.**

### What about sharks? Will we see a shark?

Possible. Imagine if we got a shark in the net, what would you do then? Dog Fish (a local, harmless shark species) come up from the depths and sometimes we catch them. The skin feels like sandpaper when you pat them.

> #### The Fjord Awakens The Norse Soul: A Moment Of Quiet Pride

### What should we wear for the trip and how about the weather?

\- You choose the season and type of weather yourself. We have fishing suits for you and yours, which keep you warm and safe from rain and cold. **If you have smaller children, I recommend bringing their own park suits and clothes that they are familiar with for maximum comfort.**

> #### Picture yourself on a trip with us. This is more than just an excursion; it’s a chance to disconnect from screens and connect with nature—and each other.

Feel free to share this unique opportunity here in Balestrand with friends, and be the first in your circle to experience the authentic fjord lifestyle.

**Don’t miss out! Secure your spot on this year’s most memorable family adventure today.**

## **A VIKING JOURNEY IN THE FJORDS WITH CAPTAIN TOR**

### This is the true fjord experience, a special and historically relevant journey

The fjord was the “road” in the old days. Rowing boats were used because steep mountains of granite made it difficult to build roads on land. Fjord means *“To travel”* from olden times. The Vikings set out by boat from Balestrand into unknown fjords in search of adventure and new discoveries.

Our boat, **“Miss Fjords,” is Sognefjord’s contemporary answer to both the resilient Fjord horse and the agile Viking ship.** The Fjord horse is Norway’s national symbol, famous for its strength and ability to navigate this rugged terrain for thousands of years. Just as those sturdy horses and ships carried our ancestors safely through the elements, “Miss Fjords” is built for stability, safety, and silent passage through these iconic waters, channeling that ancient spirit of exploration.

> #### To me, this sense of adventure never fades. After decades of guiding these waters, I find it just as fun and exciting every time. Ready to *Go Viking?* - Join us!
