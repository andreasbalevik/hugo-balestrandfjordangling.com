## **Introduction: Your Ultimate Fjærland Glacier Adventure**

### **Q: Where does this exclusive adventure take place?**

A: Escape to Fjærland, Sognefjord: A premium e-bike & boat glacier adventure that allows you to explore Supphelledalen's pristine nature.

### **Q: What makes this a "must-do" experience?**

A: This is an exclusive, guided, authentic—your ultimate Norwegian bucket-list experience.

## **WHO IS THIS EXCLUSIVE TOUR BEST SUITED FOR?**

### **Q: Who is this unique boat and e-bike combination trip designed for?**

**A:** This is for seasoned travelers who are used to traveling and who collect unique travel experiences. This is a private, rustic open boat adventure route (we provide boots and immersion suits) for you who want to experience stunning, pristine places along the Sognefjord with the legendary Captain Tor—a world-class experience for guests who are always on the go.

### **Q: What makes the combination of a boat and e-bike unique?**

**A:** For those who love cycling and exploring new places, this combination is completely unique. This is genuinely something you can brag about having done. A fun, exploratory fjord experience to a glacier that will absolutely top your bucket list.

#### **Practical Information & Booking**

### **Q: How do we manage reservations and weather for this expedition?**

**A:** Make a reservation directly. If the weather is favourable, **this trip is good to go!** Check the local [weather forecast here.](https://www.yr.no/nb/v%C3%A6rvarsel/daglig-tabell/1-137231/Norge/Vestland/Sogndal/Fj%C3%A6rlandsfjorden)

> *(Please note that this program is purely sightseeing and includes no fishing activities.)*

### **Q: Do you have any video inspiration from the tour?**

**A:** Yes, absolutely! To really get a feel for the atmosphere, we've put together some short Instagram Reels. Take a look and let yourself be inspired by the magic of the Fjærlandsfjord:

#### **WHEN THE JOURNEY IS THE DESTINATION**

### **Q: What is the experience like on the boat and the atmosphere we can expect?**

**A:** This journey is a transformation in itself. Find tranquility and value as we drive along the entire fjord, witnessing diverse waterfalls, glaciers, and remote homesteads inaccessible by road. Embrace the elements: decompress on the boat’s bow, feel the fresh air flicker in your hair, or the rain kissing your cheek.

Add a Norwegian flag, and you are officially on a fjord expedition! This is a unique way to get close to the fjord, yourself, and nature. Some guests describe this trip as a "Fjord gallop"—that’s a cool thing, wanna try?

#### **STORYTELLING ENHANCES THIS UNIQUE FJORD JOURNEY**

### **Q: Does the tour include cultural insights and local stories?**

**A:** We pause regularly while Captain Tor shares local sagas. You can drink pure water right from the source, feel fresh water on your face, and breathe in the smell of purity and pristine nature. Observe the seasonal changes, from blossoming trees in May and June to the stunning green glacier water that colours the fjord from June to August.

#### **WE EXPLORE SUPPHELLEDALEN AND ITS GLACIER BY E-BIKE**

### **Q: What does the e-bike portion of the tour involve?**

**A:** This is a truly fun and exciting twist. We deploy our e-bikes from the boat and explore a whole new village. Fjærland is distinctly different from Balestrand—very retro, a bit stuck in the past. It's a tranquil landscape of dairy farmers, The Book Town, and dramatic glaciers. We cycle crisscrossing small roads in this charming, little-visited valley, stopping at the base of the glacier for a breathtaking view.

#### **LET GO - BREATHE - TIME FOR WONDER & CALIBRATION**

### **Q: What is the emotional or 5D value of this journey?**

**A:** This experience is the perfect moment for **calibration** and mindfulness. You are free from thoughts and worries, living entirely in the moment. The combination of dynamic travel and quiet reflection allows for deep internal work.

> ***"The outer journey facilitates the inner journey. The fjord is a mirror for your soul.”***

Whether it rains or shines, the essence is about presence and perspective—finding happiness far away from the distractions of daily life, reflecting on the constant pull of the new and unknown, and the comfort of nostalgia.

#### **TRAVEL IS AN EXPRESSION OF INDIVIDUALITY**

### **Q: Why is this considered an exclusive, high-end experience?**

**A:** In the premium travel market, travel is not just about practical use, but rather an expression of individuality and the pursuit of curated experiences. A fjord adventure with us is a piece of iconic iconography—a unique badge of honour for the discerning traveller.

## ***A VIKING JOURNEY IN THE FJORDS WITH CAPTAIN TOR***

### Q: Why is the fjord experience so special and historically relevant?

A: The fjord was the “road” in the old days. Rowing boats were used because steep mountains of granite made it difficult to build roads on land. Fjord means *“To travel”* from olden times. The Vikings set out by boat from Balestrand into unknown fjords in search of adventure and new discoveries.

Our boat, **“Miss Fjords,” is Sognefjord’s contemporary answer to both the resilient Fjord horse and the agile Viking ship.** The Fjord horse is Norway’s national symbol, famous for its strength and ability to navigate this rugged terrain for thousands of years. Just as those sturdy horses and ships carried our ancestors safely through the elements, “Miss Fjords” is built for stability, safety, and silent passage through these iconic waters, channeling that ancient spirit of exploration.

> *“To me, this sense of adventure never fades. After decades of guiding these waters, I find it just as fun and exciting every time.”*

#### **“Ready to ‘Go Viking’? *Join us!”***
