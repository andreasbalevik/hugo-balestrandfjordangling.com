#### **SMALL, SIMPLE JOYS - MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES AND MEANINGFUL DISCOVERIES**

I walk this terrain regularly both as light exercise and to decompress thoughts for myself. Snowshoe hiking in Winter time and hiking in summertime. On these trips of mine, get a good sense of the joy of achievement and easy expedition mastery. It’s always a bit of a challenge to get out the door. Familiar feeling?  I am always enriched after such a trip. At the same time, it is always nice to go with someone and share the joy of nature with someone.

#### **P﻿ICK SOME BLUEBERRIES & EXPERIENCE THE LOCAL PEOPLE ALONG THE SOGNEFJORD**

Nature speaks to us in so many ways. Time for reflection and wonder. This is the advantage of a personal guide. Someone who can show the way, open your eyes while you settle your status with yourself and find peace and new inspiration in the mountains. Am I right?

#### **THE BRIDGE OVER TROUBLE WATER - A RED, SMALL COTTAGE AND *THE SAUSAGE PLACE***

Up here and inside the valley is a small metal bridge. It’s rusty and old and crooked, but still solid. As a boy I thought this bridge was scary to cross. Today I just laugh at this. Such are childhood memories. We grow on this, which is why such simple experiences are so important! ! I call it *“The bridge over troubled waters “* - Catchy title isn’t it?

#### **C﻿OLD HANDS - VARM HEART - *I AM SOGNEFJORD!***

Imagine this:

Deafening silence, surrounded by old robust pine trees.

Below you see a deep, blue fjord that stretches as far as the eye can see.

You feel the fresh mountain air caress your cheek.

Mountain air fills the lungs and all worries disappear.

Y﻿ou feel strong, vital and alive….That’s cool and it’s fun too!
