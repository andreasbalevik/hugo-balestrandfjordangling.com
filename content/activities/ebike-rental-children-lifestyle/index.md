  included:
    - Helmets and child seat are included in the rental price. Bike Lock
  practical:
    - 3 hours is usually enough rental time. If you want a rental period beyond
      3 hours, we will arrange this when you meet us at the Balestrand Adventure
      House. You must fill out a handover responsibility form before using the
      bike. You test that the bike is OK and works properly before the trip.
    - "TIP: One person wants to train a regular bike and the other person does
      not want to ride a bike at all - Then you rent 1 electric bike in addition
      to the regular bike, switch on turbo mode and speed away! It's perfectly
      ok and you do something sporty together :)"
