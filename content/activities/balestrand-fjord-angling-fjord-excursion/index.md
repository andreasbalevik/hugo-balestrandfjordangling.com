Ladies and gentlemen; The best way to inspire is with your own story. To lift others up. 

#### **GET ACCESS TO FASCINATING STORIES ABOUT THE DRAGON HOUSES IN BALESTRAND**

#### **F﻿UN F﻿JORD ANGLING: *"Hey I've got a fish!"***

Fjord fishing in the beautiful, legendary #esefjord surrounded by high, picturesque mountains: - When I was a little boy, my mother used to send me out to the fjord to catch the fish called: Sand Whiting. They are fun to fish, bite easily on the hook and taste good for lunch. Some call them *“Fjord Chicken”* - What a cool name!

#### **W﻿HEN SKIES CLEAR: *"Hope shines throught"***

Fishing trip to the smallholdings in the beautiful #fjærlandsfjorden is excellent for traditional trolling allonge the cliffs for Pollock, mackerel, salmon or trout. This is the local culture of fishing and relaxing in the fjord landscape. 

#### **P﻿RISTINE FJORDS:  *"It's noe one else in here! Only us.."***

The Fjærlandsfjord in bright season is green colored by the melt water from the glacier village Fjærland. Here we also find diverse animal and bird life such as eagles and occasionally killer whales looking for seals and porpoises. In the late winter, the deer stay down on the shore.

#### **S﻿IMLICITY CREATS EMOTIONS: *"This is so nice.."***

Scenic Boat route in Fjærlandsfjorden **\-** The energy in #fjærlandsfjorden is special, more original and therefore more powerful. There is something in here between the high mountains that nourishes both the heart and the spirit. It makes us strong men and women. Clean water, fresh air, homesteads. Here you can find peace, inspiration and space for wonder. In the old days, this beautiful fjord was referred to as *“Fjordland”*

> #### ***"I feel I have gotten to know the Sognefjord myself.."***

*B﻿y the way, it’s nice and tidy too..*
