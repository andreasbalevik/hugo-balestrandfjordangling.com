#### **LEARN MORE ABOUT THE *DRAGON HOUSES* FROM THE SEA SIDE**

I﻿t's so much more fun from a boat than a cultural tour on land, right? So on this excursion you will see the famous red dragon villas in Balestrand from the sea side and learn a little about the people who built them. Sightseeing with entertaining and good storytelling by Captain Tor. Tor has grown up here in the village and knows how this should be done.

#### **F﻿UN F﻿JORD ANGLING - *RE-EXPERIENCE GOOD CHILDHOOD MEMORIES***

Fjord fishing in the beautiful, legendary #esefjord surrounded by high, picturesque mountains: - When I was a little boy, my mother used to send me out to the fjord to catch the fish called: Sand Whiting. They are fun to fish, bite easily on the hook and taste good for lunch. Some call them *“Fjord Chicken”* . *That's a cool name!* Bring your lovely children to experience a real adventure. Together with Captain Tor, easily create your own fjord story and you will forever remain their Q*ueen of Sognefjord!*
