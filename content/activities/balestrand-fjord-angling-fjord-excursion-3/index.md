**1) On this tour you will see the famous red dragon villas in Balestrand from the sea side and learn a little about the people who built them.** Sightseeing with entertaining and good storytelling by captain Tor.

 Fjord fishing in the beautiful, legendary #esefjord surrounded by high, picturesque mountains: - When I was a little boy, my mother used to send me out to the fjord to catch the fish called: Sand Whiting. They are fun to fish, bite easily on the hook and taste good for lunch. Some call them "Fjord Chicken" What a cool name!

#### **CATCH YOUR OWN FOOD INGREDIENT OR JUST RELEASE PRESSURE**

How about catching your own fish and cooking your own dinner when you get home? Butte-fried fish served on a piece of seed loaf and with homemade salad and a bottle of the fruit drink: "Sparkling Margaret" from Balholm. It tastes like rhubarb and evokes nostalgic summer memories. Light some candles and put on some bossa nova music in the background... Then you have created a real dining experience that you do together. Buy raw materials easily in the grocery store next to the Balestrand Adventure house. 

How about a bag of fish soup, and add pieces of your fish, isn’t this easy?

p﻿s:: Not able to cook yourself? Try the tasty Sognefjord Seafood Sandwich at Kviknes Hotell after the trip and something good to drink.. 

#### **P﻿RISTINE FJORDS - *I'M LOST IN THE MONENT***

**2) Fishing trip to the smallholdings in the beautiful #fjærlandsfjorden** is excellent for traditional trolling allonge the cliffs for pollock, mackerel, salmon or trout. This is the local culture of fishing and relaxing in the fjord landscape. The Fjærlandsfjord in bright season is green colored by the melt water from the glacier village #fjærland. Here we also find diverse animal and bird life such as eagles and occasionally killer whales looking for seals and porpoises. In the late winter, the deer stay down on the shore.

\- See yourself on a trip with us, feel free to tell your friends about our opportunity here in Balestrand and make a reservation directly or contact your tour operator 

#### **S﻿IMLICETY CREATS EMOTIONS - ESCAPE, *GET LOST IN THE MOMENT..***

**3) Scenic Boat route in Fjærlandsfjorden -** The energy in #fjærlandsfjorden is special, more original and therefore more powerful. There is something in here between the high mountains that nourishes both the heart and the spirit. It makes us strong men and women. Clean water, fresh air, homesteads. Here you can find peace, inspiration and space for wonder. In the old days, this beautiful fjord was referred to as *"Fjordland"*

#### **A﻿ND THE BONUS ?**

 It gives your life a whole new dimension and a colorful twist! You like to laugh and have a great time. You are generous and adventurous, am I right?

*B﻿y the way, it's nice and tidy too..*
