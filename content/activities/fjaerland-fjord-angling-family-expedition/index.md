#### **THE ART OF EXPLORING SOMETHING TOGETHER**

Captain Tor’s fjord adventure solution works time and time again. You are looking for an activity that works, a safe choice - Am i right?

Fishing trip in beautiful, legendary #fjærlandsfjord surrounded  by high picturesque mountains. When I was a little boy, my mother used to send me out on the fjord to catch the fish called: Sand Whiting. They are fun to fish, bite easily on the hook and taste good for lunch. Some call them *“Fjord Chickens”-* Isn’t that cool?

#### **THE STORYTELLING TOPS THIS UNIQUE FJORD JOURNEY**

From the boat you will see unique homesteads such as Lidal and Teigen. Time for wonder and reflection as we travel beyond #fjærlandsfjorden. Tor tells stories and you pull up fishing nets in the Lidal Teigen area, set out by us the night before. Fish and crabs you take home and make at the cabin yourself, or prepared by agreement with Fjærland Fjordstove Hotel and the chef if you live there.

#### **CREATE AND PASS ON SOLID CHILDHOOD MEMORIES**

Catch some fish with Captain Tor and make your own dinner when you get home at your cabin or Air B&B a Butter-fried Sand Whiting served on a piece of seed-loaf and with a homemade salad and a bottle of local made fruit drink: *“Sprudllande Margaret”* from Balholm. It tastes rhubarb and evokes nostalgic summer memories. If you light some candles and put on some bossa nova music in the background, you have a real dining experience you do together. Easily buy ingredients in the grocery store next to the marina in Fjærland.

How about a bag of fish soup, and add pieces of your fish, isn’t this easy?

#### **CURIOSITY - *THE NEW SUPER POWER***

Fjærland fjord angling & family expedition as we have chosen to title it, has a nice mix and focus on activity. We have added a fishing net. A fishing nets will stimulate practical skills. We (you or the children) pull up fishing nets, set out by us the night before. In the fishing net we can catch cod, halibut and pollock, sea gilt, starfish, sea urchins and red crab. It’s ALWAYS exciting to see what you’ve got. But it can also be empty, such is life in the fjords

#### **THE SIMPLE AND AUTHENTIC IS THE NEW LUXURY**

A bit of historical context: *"Gardingane"* is a local name for people who live on the rugged farms along the 26-kilometer-long Fjærlandsfjorden.

Ever since the first foreign tourists began to flock to the western fjords in the middle of the 19th century, Fjærland with its dizzying mountains and mighty glacier arms has been an important destination.

Nowhere else in Western Norway did the glacier arms extend as far down to the fjord as the Supphelle Glacier and the Bøya Glacier in Fjærland. By the way, the village was called "Fjordland" in Old Norse times.

#### **C﻿OLD HANDS - VARM HEARTS - *I AM SOGNEFJORD***

Some practical information for you: You choose the season and type of weather yourself. We have fishing suits for you and yours, which keep you warm and safe. If you have smaller children, I recommend bringing your own park suits and clothes that they are familiar with. See yourself on a trip with us, feel free to tell your friends about our opportunity here in Fjærland and make a reservation directly or contact your tour operator 

#### **A HOLIDAY BONUS ->*THE COLORFUL TWIST!***

This simple, nice family expedition is an excellent way to give the young people and you yourselves as adults a shared destination and responsibility, while doing something exciting, fun and creative together!

B﻿y the way: *Nice and tidy too..*
