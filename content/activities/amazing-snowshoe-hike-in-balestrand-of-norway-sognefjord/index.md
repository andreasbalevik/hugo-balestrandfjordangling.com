#### **L﻿IMITS ARE A MINDSET - T﻿HRILL YOUR SENCES** 

I walk this terrain regularly both as light exercise and to decompress thoughts for myself. On these trips of mine, get a sense of the joy of achievement and easy expedition mastery. It's always a bit of a challenge to get out the door. I am always enriched after such a trip. At the same time, it is always nice to go with someone and share the joy of nature with someone.

#### **FLY & DRIVE - EXPERIENCE THE LOCAL PEOPLE ALONG THE SOGNEFJORD**

Nature speaks to me in so many ways. Time for reflection and wonder. This is the advantage of a personal guide. Someone who can show the way, while you settle your status with yourself and find peace and new inspiration in the mountains. Am I right?

#### **C﻿OLD HANDS - VARM HEART - LIGHT A FIRE - *I AM SOGNEFJORD!***

Imagine this:

Deafening silence, surrounded by pure white snow.

Below you see a deep, blue fjord that stretches as far as the eye can see.

You feel the fresh mountain air caress your cheek.

Mountain air fills the lungs and all worries disappear.

Y﻿ou feel strong, vital and alive....That's cool and it's fun too!
