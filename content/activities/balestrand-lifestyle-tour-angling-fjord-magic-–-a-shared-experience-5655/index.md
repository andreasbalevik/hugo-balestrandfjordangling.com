## **Introduction: Discover the Authentic Balestrand Experience**

### **Q: What makes this tour different from typical tourist activities?**

**A:** This is a truly authentic scenic fishing experience designed to offer unique and memorable fjord moments that set it apart from mass tourism. It’s perfect for those who want more than just a regular vacation; it combines the activity of angling with the pure ambiance of the Sognefjord, designed to offer a refreshing escape.

### **Q: Who is this excursion perfect for?**

**A:** Whether you're seeking inspiration, a team-building trip with friends, or simply looking for your next adventure—this is an opportunity to embrace. Step into the fjord and create a moment that's genuinely yours.

## **AUTHENTIC SOGNEFJORD LIFESTYLE: RAIN OR SHINE**

Here you get a 5-star attraction and this fjord experience is among Norway’s best. It has received the award: Varde experience quality. Private boat. Card payment on arrival. Trips all year round.

### **Who is this tour suitable for?**

#### **This excursion is suitable for:**

* Couples
* Families with children
* Friends traveling together
* *Business travelers FIT & Corporate events*

Don’t worry, be happy in our blue Jump-in-suits and Boots in case of a cold morning or rain. Stay warm and comfortable as we explore the Sognefjord in a local and authentic way. That’s why you’re here, right?

## **CLEAN AIR - GOOD VIBES: EXPLORE THE SOGNEFJORD**

### **1) Sightseeing: The Famous Red Dragon Villas in Balestrand**

On this tour you will see the famous red dragon villas in Balestrand from the sea side and learn a little about the people who built them. Sightseeing with entertaining and good storytelling by captain Tor.

### **2) Fjord Fishing in the Beautiful, Legendary #Esefjord**

(Surrounded by high, picturesque mountains)

When I was a little boy, my mother used to send me out to the fjord to catch the fish called: Sand Whiting. They are fun to fish, bite easily on the hook and taste good for lunch. Some call them “Fjord Chicken” What a cool name!

### Q: **How about catching my own fish and cooking my own dinner?**

A: Butte-fried fish served on a piece of seed loaf and with homemade salad and a bottle of the fruit drink: *“Sparkling Margaret”* from Balholm, (our local apple juice factory here in Balestrand!) It tastes like rhubarb and evokes nostalgic summer memories. Light some candles and put on some bossa nova music in the background… Then you have created a real dining experience that you do together.

### Q: **Where can I buy ingredients?**

A: Raw materials can be purchased easily at the grocery store next to the Balestrand Adventure house. How about a bag of fish soup, and add pieces of your fish, isn’t this easy?

### Q: **What if I’m not able to cook myself?**

A: Try the tasty Sognefjord Seafood Sandwich at Kviknes Hotell after the trip, paired with something good to drink.

#### **VIDEO: EXPERIENCE THE UNEXPECTED - HALIBUT CATCH**

*This is a family expedition where you can experience the unexpected!*

### **PRISTINE FJORDS: LOST IN THE MOMENT**

### **3) Fishing Trip to the Smallholdings in the Beautiful #Fjærlandsfjorden**

This area is excellent for traditional trolling along the cliffs for Pollock, mackerel, salmon, or trout. This represents the local fishing and relaxation culture in the fjord landscape.

### Q: What kind of nature and wildlife will we see in the Fjærlandsfjorden?

A: In bright season, the Fjærlandsfjord has a green color from the melt-water of the glacier village #Fjærland. Diverse animal and bird life, including eagles, can be found here. Occasionally, killer whales are seen looking for seals and porpoises. In late winter, deer stay down on the shore.

Consider taking a trip with us and sharing your experience with friends. Reservations can be made directly or through your tour operator.

#### **SIMPLICITY CREATES EMOTIONS - *ESCAPE***

## **4) Scenic Boat Route in Fjærlandsfjorden**

### Q: What is special about the energy here?

A: The energy in #Fjærlandsfjorden is described as special, original, and powerful. Surrounded by high mountains, it is said to nourish both the heart and the spirit. The area offers clean water, fresh air, and homesteads, providing peace, inspiration, and space for wonder. In the past, this beautiful fjord was known as ***“Fjordland”.***

#### ***AND THE BONUS?***

It adds a new dimension and a colorful twist to your life. You are likely someone who enjoys laughter, good times, is generous, and adventurous.

It’s also noted that the experience is nice and tidy.

### **On the Go? Fly & Drive Sognefjord Logistics**

Many of our guests arrive in the Sognefjord driving their own car, rental car, or motorhome/campervan after flying into Oslo (OSL), Bergen (BGO), or Ålesund (AES) airports. A stop in Balestrand for an authentic fjord experience with Captain Tor is a highlight of their itinerary. Our tours are flexible; simply park your vehicle (**Veganeset Camping, praised in The Guardian, is nearby**), jump aboard for your private excursion, and continue your journey the same day. Balestrand is centrally located between key ferry points (Dragsvik, Hella, Vangsnes), making it easy to integrate into your logistics. [Find the ferry timetable on the link HERE.](https://www.norled.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/fc6193ba-0fca-4561-b498-2e6f9898a40a.pdf)
