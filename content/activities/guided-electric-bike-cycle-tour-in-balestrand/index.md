#### **THE SOGNEFJORD - THE WORLD'S LONGEST MEETING PLACE**

It is the storytelling and the time together with Tor that make this an authentic travel experience. Tor grew up here in Balestrand, he knows the fun places to cycle. Tor knows how to do this.

#### **HE BIKES. SHE BIKES - EVERYBODY E-BIKES**

Go for a bike ride and shake off some thoughts and pedal a little. This is a very nice way to experience daily life in a fjord village. 

#### **FJORD CYCLING - *PEDAL MUSCLES AND A DING DONG LIFE STYLE***

Take the pulse of the Sognefjord right NOW. A little flower power, cheerful feelings and a twinkle in the eye are what always spice up a travel experience. It's about meeting new people, feeling like a local resident and participating in activities together.

> #### **TRAVELING IS NOT ABOUT PRACTICAL USE, BUT RATHER AN EXPRESSION OF INDIVIDUALITY. A FJORD ADVENTURE IS JUST A PIECE OF ICONOGRAPHY..**
