## **Introduction: Master the Long Line – Your Authentic Fjord Challenge**

Master authentic long line fishing with a premium, hands-on skill immersion & unique fishing adventure. Book your memorable escape today!

### **What is included in the price, and when is the tour available:**

The price includes 2 persons in a private boat, and the tour is available year-round. Note: This highly sought-after premium skill immersion requires booking three days in advance to ensure authenticity.

### **This is the itinerary for this fishing immersion:**

Your journey into the real life of a local fisherman begins the evening before with bait preparation at 6:00 pm. We cast off from Balestrand sharp at 9:00 am the next day for the longline haul.

### **Is this a passive sightseeing tour?**

No, this is not a passive tour; it’s an authentic challenge. As an acting crew member, you are pushed to make decisions, master yourself, and connect with the raw elements of the pristine Sognefjord.

### **The true Norseman feeling I expect from the "thrill of the catch"?**

Experience the visceral thrill of the catch—blood, sweat, and the electric tension of hauling a live "floating football" onto the deck. This is your moment to find focus, where life is simplified and the digital detox takes control while you work the line.

## **From City Slicker to Fjord Fisherman: Your Authentic Day at Sea Awaits**

### **What makes this a genuine, authentic fishing experience:**

**The Real Stuff, Local & Genuine – Explore yourself as a Fisherman!**

**Captain Tor** operates a specially built **Øien 710F**—the "F" stands for fisher. The boat is clean, tidy, simple, and safe. This long-line fishery is proper local tradition for food, reaching depths down to 1000m. This is how the family has been fishing for four generations. We’re offering you a piece of genuine **Norwegian heritage**.

### **How do I become a real fisherman for a day?**

Exchange the city's pace for the Sognefjord's calm and power! Ready for an adventure? This is an experiential expedition where you meet nature head-on. We're talking collaboration with Norway's longest fjord! Feel the excitement build as you cast out, feel the jerk on the line, and experience the joy of a good catch. This is your moment to feel alive, create unforgettable memories, and experience fishing up close. April and May offer great conditions for spring fishing. An experience that guarantees excitement and satisfaction for everyone!

### **Do you have any video inspiration from the tour?**

Yes, absolutely! To really get a feel for the atmosphere, we’ve put together some short Instagram Reels. Take a look and let yourself be inspired by the magic of the Sognefjord:

### **What is the process and the feeling of the catch?**

**The Real Teamwork: Anticipation & The Haul**

Experience the excitement and the wait! The "Fjord Chicken" challenge starts the night before when we bait the hooks. Imagine waking up in your fjord cabin, checking the weather, having breakfast with friends, and arriving at the ready boat in the marina—that genuine, local fisherman feeling.

**You Are a Fisherman on the Way Out: Proud, Strong – The Real Feeling**

Be a morning bird. Be one of the local fishermen. You wave to the guests at the Kvikne’s Hotel. You are motivated, breathing that fresh morning air. This is vitality—it’s time to live the life you want today.

### **What is the actual fishing process like?**

**Sognefjord – Home of Kraken, The Sea Monster. Let’s Haul Up Some Big Beasts**

The fish are usually big in these deep fjords. The long line makes them float up like footballs coming up from the deep. Something dark, big, or shiny is rising up. Hook it. Cut its throat. You’ve done it before. You are a hunter. It’s gutted for sale to local buyers, or you bring it home. Food on the table. **You are a provider.** Feeling proud!

**The Master and the Commander**

You pick up the marker buoy with a grabber. The Øien 710F boat handles the situation—steady. Challenges are just a possibility for growth. Every day is just a new beginning. One step forward is one step closer. "If it is to be, it’s up to me."

### **What if we don't catch anything:**

**Limits Are a Mindset: Resilience & Growth**

An empty fishing net doesn’t stop a true explorer. You know what you want, and you move forward until you get it. You never fail; either you learn from it or you win! Today you choose to be completely happy, no matter what. Today you are vibrant, healthy, and alive. This is the **Viking Spirit** in action.

### **This is the feeling on the way back to Balestrand!**

**Masculine Emotions – Be a Man, Put Some Food on the Table**

Seagulls follow us back to the marina. The sound from the Honda BF100 is pure quality. You’ve got that funny smile and the glimpse in your eye. That feeling gives you power and recognition. You have self-esteem. You have control over yourself and the circumstances.

## ***A VIKING JOURNEY IN THE FJORDS WITH CAPTAIN TOR***

### This is why the fjord experience so special and historically relevant:

A: The fjord was the “road” in the old days. Rowing boats were used because steep mountains of granite made it difficult to build roads on land. Fjord means *“To travel”* from olden times. The Vikings set out by boat from Balestrand into unknown fjords in search of adventure and new discoveries.

Our boat, **“Miss Fjords,” is Sognefjord’s contemporary answer to both the resilient Fjord horse and the agile Viking ship.** The Fjord horse is Norway’s national symbol, famous for its strength and ability to navigate this rugged terrain for thousands of years. Just as those sturdy horses and ships carried our ancestors safely through the elements, “Miss Fjords” is built for stability, safety, and silent passage through these iconic waters, channeling that ancient spirit of exploration.

> *“To me, this sense of adventure never fades. After decades of guiding these waters, I find it just as fun and exciting every time.”*
