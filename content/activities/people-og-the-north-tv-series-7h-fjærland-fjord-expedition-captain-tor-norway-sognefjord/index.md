#### SIMPLICITY IS THE NEW LUXURY

You  deserve the best! Therefore, join Captain Tor. Let him shake up body, spirit and soul with his unique, creative boat program that hits the mark every time. *"Eksklusive Skandinavia"* - Stylish working title, right?

#### L﻿IMITS ARE A MINDSET

Especially aimed at you who are financially free or are entrepreneurs. Genuine solutions with a world-class seamless experience! Tor has completely unique qualities as a maritime STCW instructor, creates a good atmosphere. This genuine fjord program that both inspires and calibrates the mindset of most people. Are you ready for cheerful pranks?

#### T﻿HE TASTE OF THE SOGNEFJORD - LOCAL FOOD CULTURE

Get on, and work in proper professional oil hire and sea boots for fishermen. Enter size (S-XL) when booking a trip, so that this is clear to you when Tor arrives at Fjærland marina or Fjærland Fjordstove Hotell. You can of course keep the fish home if you wish. Excellent short-haul self-caught quality fish that is perfect for a local meal story served from the kitchen Fjærland Fjordstove Hotell

Here you also get the opportunity to join Tor out in the boat for a couple of hours the night before which we lay out gear for the following day. Feel the real feeling of anticipation of catching the next day, as you lie down to sleep at night. Incredibly rewarding experience. It is completely real.

#### THE EXCITED FEELING OF BEING A LOCAL FISHERMAN

The combination of fjord nets at depth, *"Troll nets" (*local name for a type of fishing net*)* and exciting halibut line means that we can see and catch different types of fish and crabs on this trip. We use halibut hooks with quick-snaps on the halibut line which makes this safer when it comes to large fish.

You as a participant are actively involved in the actual pulling and hauling and processing of the catch on board the boat. There will be work here. We use an electric winch to haul implements from around 110 meters deep. Feel the sense of simplification and control takes you over as you work and finds solutions to thoughts and problems as we work. Very fun experience.

I have a table, which I set up on board the boat for filleting. The seagulls gather around us on the water and eat fish fillets that we throw out. This creates a nice spring atmosphere around us on the fjord. Must be experienced!

#### SOGNEFJORD'S MOST EXPERIENCED INSTRUCTOR IN HIS FIELD

Captain Tor has experience so it holds. He guides in the background when needed and takes care so that this becomes a nice, safe and educational course experience that works for all of you. Be prepared for slightly monotonous work movements

#### HISTORICAL RUSH AMONG HIGH MOUNTAINS AND GLACIERS

We stay in the inner part of the fjord arm, the area Mundal - Lidal. It's cold out at sea at this time of year, so put on good wool underwear. Hat and mittens of good quality. Here in the Fjærlandsfjord is calm and mostly flat sea, but there may be some gusts in March. When the sun peeks out, you feel the heat spread in your body and we have an incredibly wonderful winter-spring atmosphere. An extra edge to the experience and you feel tough and strong! Remember to bring sunglasses :)

#### MAKE YOU LIFE MORE COMPLETE

Feel free to have an "After-sauna" in Dampen afterwards. Get up close to real nature, real fjords and real people as you plunge into a cooling fjord

#### S﻿IMLICETY CREATES EMOTINS -

Welcome to try yourself as a local fisherman with Captain Tor in his unique, Norwegian-built boat in the legendary Fjærlandsfjorden!
