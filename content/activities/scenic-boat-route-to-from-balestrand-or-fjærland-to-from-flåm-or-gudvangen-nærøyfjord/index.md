#### **B﻿ALESTRAND DEPARTURE - WHEN THE JOURNEY IS THE DESTINATION**

Different water falls, glaciers, homestead places without road. Find tranquility and value as we drive along the entire fjord. A misty morning, a little rain and you glow like a real Viking! Decompress! Sit on the boat’s bow and dangle with your legs outside the boat, and feel the fresh air flicker in your hair, or the rain kissing your cheek. 

Add a Norwegian flag and you are on a fjord expedition! This is a very nice way to get close to the fjord, your self and nature. Some guests describe this trip as a “Fjord gallop”

#### **THE STORYTELLING TOPS THIS UNIQUE FJORD JOURNEY**

We stop regularly and Captain Tor tells little stories. You drink water right from the source. You feel fresh water on your face and the smell of purity and nature. Trees that bloom in May and June. 

#### **LET GO - BREATHE - TIME FOR WONDER - *A BEUTIFUL LIFE***

You are free from all thoughts and worries and are living in the moment as we drives the boat. You are wonderful and grateful at the same time. Whether it rains or sunshine, it might blow a bit… It doesn’t matter for you to live and exist! Happiness.. and presence and.. far away at the same time …. in a distant place away from home. And You find your self thinking about things at home and in life. This constant attraction of being on the road to something new and unknown.. and the familiar nostalgia..
