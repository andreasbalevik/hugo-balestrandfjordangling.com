#### **THE ART OF MAKING SOMETHING**

Captain Tor's fjord solutions works time and time again. You are looking for an activity that works, a safe choice - Am i right? 

A fishing trip in beautiful, legendary #esefjorden surrounded by high picturesque mountains: When I was a little boy, my mother used to send me out on the fjord to catch the fish called: Sand Whiting. They are fun to fish, bite easily on the hook and taste good for lunch. Some call them  *“Fjord Chickens”-* Isn’t that cool?

#### **CREATE AND PASS ON SOLID CHILDHOOD MEMORIES - *I'VE GOT A FISH!***

**Imagine this is happened to you:** Catch some fish with Captain Tor and make your own dinner when you get home. Butter-fried Sand Whiting served on a piece of seed-loaf and with a homemade salad and a bottle of local made fruit drink: “Sprudllande Margaret” from Balholm. It tastes rhubarb and evokes nostalgic summer memories. If you light some candles and put on some bossa nova music in the background, you have a real dining experience you do together. Easily buy ingredients in the grocery store next to the Balestrand Adventure house.

How about a bag of fish soup, and add pieces of your fish, isn't this easy?

#### **CURIOSITY - *THE NEW SUPER POWER ->STARFISH ARE SO CUTE and LOOK AT THE CRAB!***

Balestrand fjord angling & family expedition, has the same basic program as our popular LIFESTYLE program, LEGACY has more focus on activity and we has also added a fishing net. A fishing net will stimulate practical skills. We (You or the children) pull up fishing nets, set out by us the night before. In the fishing net we can catch cod, halibut and pollock, sea gilt, starfish, sea urchins and red crab. It's ALWAYS exciting to see what you've got. But it can also be empty, such is life in the fjords.

Imagine if we got a shark in the net, what would you do then? Dog Fish (a local shark species) come up from the depths and sometimes we catch them. The skin is like sandpaper when you pat them..

#### **M﻿Y HANDS ARE C﻿OLD, BUT MY HEART IS WARM -> *I AM SOGNEFJORD!***

You choose the season and type of weather yourself. We have fishing suits for you and yours, which keep you warm and safe. If you have smaller children, I recommend bringing your own park suits and clothes that they are familiar with. See yourself on a trip with us, feel free to tell your friends about our opportunity here in Balestrand and make a reservation directly or contact your tour operator.

#### ***L﻿ET'S GO VIKING IN THE FJORDS***

The fjord was the road in the old days. Rowing boats were used. Steep mountains of granite make it difficult to build roads on land. Boat was much easier. The rowing boat was the "car". Fjord means *"To travel"* from olden times. The Vikings set out by boat from Balestrand into unknown fjords in search of adventure and new discoveries. This is what you experience with my family expedition. I think it's just as fun and exciting every time. Do you want to *"Go Viking"* with me?

#### **I﻿T'S A HOLIDAY BONUS - *THE COLORFUL TWIST- TIME TO SURPRISE SOMEONE***

This simple, nice family expedition is an excellent way to give the young people and yourselves as adults a shared destination and responsibility, while doing something exciting, fun and creative together!

**B﻿y the way:** Nice and tidy, simple and safe too..
