### Reasons to Go: Freedom, Vitality & Unique Motifs

#### Flexibility for All:

If one person wants a light workout to Dragsvik, for example, you can rent 2 bicycles: 1 regular and 1 electric bicycle. This way it will be an enjoyable experience for both.

### GO FARTHER. GO FASTER. GO SLOW. REASONS TO GO?

* Take a trip to the other side of Balestrand. To Dragsvik. Little traffic on the road, but a world of beautiful nature. With a side mirror, you see what’s coming behind you. Make a stop. Flowers along the roadside. The **feeling of mastery**.

### Explore the Hidden Gems: Our Recommended Stops

* **St. Olaf’s Church (The “Frozen” Church):** Stop at the white church and see if you can find the grave of Margaret Sophia Green, the founder. It is located under the large tree in front of the church door and has a tall, RED tower-like tombstone with gold lettering.
* **The Enamel Workshop:** Look for the road sign on the left and go up a hill. Put your bike in 1st gear and pedal to the end of the road. Here you will find two friendly jewelers in their workshop.
* **The Old Rectory (Lunde):** At Lunde, on the lower side of the road with many tall trees and a white house. It’s an old rectory, with Northern Europe’s tallest Monkey-tale Tree and freely walking hens, chickens, and a proud rooster.
* **The Quay:** Sit on the quay and dangle your legs and enjoy the silence. Buy a sandwich and some snacks. Life is wonderful with a fjord view!
* **Menes:** Or cycle to Menes, the end point of the 3-fjord-ride. The choice is yours. The Sognefjord is full of undiscovered opportunities. Discover them. Use them!

## **Safety & Logistics**

#### Remember to lock your bike when you leave it, wear a helmet. For safety’s sake.
